# UTD CS 2340.001 Term Project: 3 in a Line
Swarita Kelwada and Suraj Khosla

## About
- This program is essentially a “Connect 3” game created using MIPS and compiled/executed using the MARS MIPS compiler. 
- Two players take turns placing their coins on the “board” until one player gets three in a line. Whoever does get three in a line is deemed the winner of the game, and the players can choose to play again or quit.
